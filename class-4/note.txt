-------------------Week 3-----------------
  -----Middleware and Global Catches-----

  Middleware are use to check the pre-checks.(check the file midlwre.js)
  (app.use(express.json())) To catch the body from the client.


  Global catches => when something is wrong with the server we should not expose the backend to the user we just send a cleaner text (
    by use of the global catches which take 4 arguments.
  )
example => app.use(function(err,req,res,next){
  res.json({
    msg: "something is wrong with the server"
  })
})


what is zod and how can we use it for input validation?
ans => zod does the work to check the input.


---------------------Authentication--------------------
dumb way- ask the user for username and password in all request in headers.(not the best way to do it )

Slightly better way-
1. Give the user back token on sign in/up.
2. Ask the user to send back the token in all future requests.
3. When the user log out, ask the user to forgot the token(or revoke it from the backend)
